# Little_Bang_Board
This project is for a Pinball game controller based on a Rasberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython.  The project requires electronic assembly such as soldering, wiring, and crimping. In addition the project requires following software installation instructions.  This project is offered as is, and free to copy and use. 
Items in this project that I am providing include Instructions, BOM, links to Adafruit CircuitPython for Pico, links to Adafruit CircuitPython libraries, Circuit diagram, Code.py -Main Code, and Boot.py -boot code.
