# Little_Bang_Board
This project is for a Virtual Pinball game controller based on a Rasberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython.  The Little Bang Board provides a virtual ball plunger using the game controller Z axis of a joystick output.  An accelerometer provides X/Y movement to the applicable game controller X/Y joystick output. A true USB keyboard HID emulation provides 16 buttons that can emulate any key.  Basic pinball game controllers can cost anywhere from $40 to $125. The Little Bang Board will set you back $10 and will be as good if not better than the more expensive competition. THis project can also be purchased as a complete kit for under $20.  This project is offered as is, and free to copy and use provided that it is not used for profit unless my written permission.  
Items in this project that I am providing include Instructions, BOM, PCB fab files (gerbers and drill files) links to Adafruit CircuitPython for Pico, links to Adafruit CircuitPython libraries, schematics, config.txt, Code.py -Main Code, and Boot.py -boot code. Please enjoy this project.
