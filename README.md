# Little_Bang_Board
This project is for a Pinball game controller based on a Rasberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython.  The Little Bang Board provides a virtual ball plunger using the game controller Z axis of a joystick output.  An accelerometer provides X/Y movement to the applicable game controller X/Y joystick output. A true USB keyboard HID emulation provides 16 buttons that can emulate any key.  Basic pinball game controllers can cost anywhere from $40 to $125. The Little Bang Board will set you back $10 and will be as good if not better than the more expensive competition. The project requires electronic assembly such as soldering, wiring, and crimping. In addition, the project requires following software installation instructions.  This project is offered as is, and free to copy and use. 
Items in this project that I am providing include Instructions, BOM, links to Adafruit CircuitPython for Pico, links to Adafruit CircuitPython libraries, Circuit diagram, Code.py -Main Code, and Boot.py -boot code. Please enjoy this project.
